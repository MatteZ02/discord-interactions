You can contact us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2qFkF3qqmu)

# Usage

```js
const { Client } = require("discord-slash-commands-client");
// TypeScript: import { Client } from "discord-slash-commands-client";

const client = new Client(
  "you unique bot token",
  "your bots user id"
);

// list all your existing commands.
client.getCommands().then(console.log).catch(console.error);

// will create a new command and log its data. If a command with this name already exist will that be overwritten.
client
  .createCommand({
    name: "unique command name",
    description: "description for this unique command",
  })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);

// will edit the details of a command.
client
  .editCommand(
    { name: "new command name", description: "new command description" },
    "id of the command you wish to edit"
  )
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);

// will delete a command
client
  .deleteCommand("id of the command you wish to delete")
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

# API

Passing a guildID is optional. Doing so will make the command only be available on that guild.
Guild commands update **instantly**. We recommend you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they're ready for public use.

# Types

You can find a list of Data Models and Types from [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#data-models-and-types)

# Interaction with the command

To receive an interaction with the command (when an user uses the command) there are 2 options.

1. You can setup a webhook-based interaction. You can read more about how to do this from the [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#receiving-an-interaction)
2. If you're using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) you can use my own [fork](https://github.com/MatteZ02/discord.js) to receive events for interaction.

## Events

We'll cover using the 2nd option.

Replace your current discord.js with my fork `npm i https://github.com/MatteZ02/discord.js`
You can listen to the interactionCreate event which will fire every time someone uses any of the commands created for your bot.

### Usage with djs

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const interactions = require("discord-slash-commands-client");

// create a new client
const client = new Discord.Client();
const token = "Your unique bot token";

// attach the interaction client to discord.js client
client.interactions = new interactions.Client(token, "You bots user id");

// attach and event listener for the ready event
client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("Client is ready!");

  // Create a new command that we can test
  client.interactions
    .createCommand({
      name: "ping",
      description: "ping pong",
    })
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
});

// attach and event listener for the interactionCreate event
client.on("interactionCreate", async (interaction) => {
  if (interaction.name === "ping") {
    // send an initial reply
    await interaction.reply("Pong");

    // send a followup
    const messageId = await interaction.reply({
      content: "Follow up message",
      embeds: [new MessageEmbed().setDescription("Follow up test")],
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
      // delete initial reply
      interaction.delete();

      // edit 1st followup
      interaction.edit("Edited follow up message", messageId);
    }, 5000);
  }
});

// login
client.login(token);
```

### interaction example response

```JS
id: string;
token: string;
channel: Discord.TextChannel;// The channel where this interaction occurred
guild: Discord.Guild;// The guild where this interaction occurred
member: Discord.GuildMember | null;// The guild member who issued the interaction (will be null if we cannot obtain a guildMember)
author: Discord.User | null;// The user who issued the interaction (will be null if we cannot obtain an user)
name: string;// name of this command
content: string;// content of this command (everything after the main command name)
createdTimestamp: number;// timestamp of this command being used
options: { value: string; name: string }[] | null;// list of options this user inputted to the command
